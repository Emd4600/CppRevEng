This small example is designed for the videogame **Spore**. At some point in the game, you can use a tool called *Hologram Scout* that shows the player as an hologram. This DLL hooks the function responsible for that, and ensures the hologram is never shown.

This is a simple adaptation of a much broader project, the [Spore ModAPI SDK](https://github.com/Emd4600/Spore-ModAPI).
